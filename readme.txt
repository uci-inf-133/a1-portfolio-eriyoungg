--Readme document for *Erika Young*, *erikasy@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

    10/10
    - 1/1 Readme
    - 2/2 Basic HTML content
    - 1/1 Basic CSS styling
    - 1/1 Advanced feature
    - 2/2 Responsive layout
    - 1/1 Passes validation checks
    - 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

    My portfolio consists of basic features such as clickable links that redirect to the correct websites, images with alt text, a footer on each page, custom fonts, appropriate headings and paragraph text, and multiple pages of content.

(b) CSS features

    While developing my portfolio, I integrated Bootstrap CSS helpers such as the grid system, spacing utilities, and typography helpers. I also wanted to make my page more aetsthetically pleasing by integrating a "glass" effect on some features of my pages. The font size and color was also changed to make a cohesive, pretty UI.

(c) Advanced features

    One advanced feature I implemented was a navigation bar that allows for seamless movement between pages. It is integrated with the gradient background to remain cohesive with the layout.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

    I did not have nor did I ignore any warnings presented by the accessibility checker.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

    It took me about 4-5 hours of actual coding to complete this assignment, excluding reading the directions and submission.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

    I used these resources:
    a. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples
    b. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp
    c. https://css.glass/

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

    I did not consult anyone else for this assignment.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

    No.
